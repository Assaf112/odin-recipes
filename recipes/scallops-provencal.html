        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound fresh bay or sea scallops</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour, for dredging</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped shallots (2 large)</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves</li>
            <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 lemon, cut in 1/2</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>If you're using bay scallops, keep them whole. If you're using sea scallops, cut each 1 in half horizontally. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, toss with flour, and shake off the excess.</li>
            <li>In a very large saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over high heat until sizzling and add the scallops in 1 layer. Lower the heat to medium and allow the scallops to brown lightly on 1 side without moving them, then turn and brown lightly on the other side. This should take 3 to 4 minutes, total. Melt the rest of the butter in the pan with the scallops, then add the shallots, garlic, and parsley and saute for 2 more minutes, tossing the seasonings with the scallops. Add the wine, cook for 1 minute, and taste for seasoning. Serve hot with a squeeze of lemon juice.

        </ol>
