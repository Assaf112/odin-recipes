        <p>Melted potato recipe turns your favorite spud into creamy, caramelized bites</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 russet potatoes</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>Flaky salt, to garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Peel the potatoes and slice off the ends. Cut into 1-inch slices. Season both sides of the potatoes generously with kosher salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet (or other heavy-duty, ovenproof skillet) over medium-high heat. Add the oil and 4 tablespoons of the butter. Sear the potatoes on one side until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip the potatoes and add the broth, rosemary and garlic. Cut the remaining 6 tablespoons butter into cubes and scatter on top of the potatoes. Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook until fork-tender, about 30 minutes. Garnish with flaky salt and spoon the pan sauce all over the potatoes.</li>
